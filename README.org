- This repo is used for all my boilerplates.
- At the moment it's mainly docker-compose files.
- Every boilerplate has its own README that explains every single line of code.
- For some of the files there are requirement and/or usage guides. These will also be in the README.
- Many of these need to be adapted to your person use-case. These variable are marked with ~< >~.

At the moment I prefer to use Nginx Proxy Manager but most of these boilerplates are already set up for Traefik.
If you don't plan on using Traefik, just remove the Traefik labels, remove the proxy network and in some cases re-add the the ~ports: -...:...~
