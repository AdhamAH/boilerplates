- This repo is used for all my boilerplates.
- At the moment it's mainly docker-compose files.
- Every boilerplate has its own README that explains every single line of code.
- For some of the files there are requirement and/or usage guides. These will also be in the README.
- Many of these need to be adapted to your person use-case. These variable are marked with ~< >~.
